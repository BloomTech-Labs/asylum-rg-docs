## Description

BL-75 Iterate design artifacts to include search and filter functionality
We replaced the search bar and dropdown buttons with actual Ant Design components to get a better understanding of what they will look like.
Year dropdown will filter between Calendar and Fiscal years,
View dropdown will filter between Spreadsheet, Heatmap, Trends Over Time and USIC Offices.
Search bar will allow users to filter specific items in the data. The result of the search will be visible on the table that is selected.
